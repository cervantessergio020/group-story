a. why did you branch prior to making changes?
So it didnt mess up the main branch. making a branch let me add my part without affecting the original file

git status shows you what changed and before commit it tells you what fies have been changes and what is going on in the working directory. When you do it after commit it tells you eveythging is cleam
